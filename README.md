------------------------------------------Welcome to the Basic-Daily Coding Challenge repository!-----------------------------------------

This repository contains a collection of basic coding challenges that you can solve to improve your coding skills.
Each challenge is designed to take less  than  half-hour to solve and is focused on a specific concept or programming language.

******************************************************************************************************************************************

To get started, simply choose a challenge from the list and try to solve it using your favorite programming language. 
You can find the instructions for each challenge in the corresponding folder.


If you're new to programming or want to practice a particular language, we recommend starting with the easier challenges and working your way up.

Some tips for solving these challenges:
       
       1.Read the instructions carefully and make sure you understand what the challenge is asking you to do.
       2.Break the problem down into smaller sub-problems and tackle each one separately.
       3.Test your code frequently to make sure it's working correctly.
       4.Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck. You can always ask for help in the comments section of the challenge or in online forums.
       5.After you've solved a challenge, take some time to review your code and see if you can make it more efficient or elegant.
